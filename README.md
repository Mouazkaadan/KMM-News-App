# KMP News App

### Project Description

A simple app that I created with **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile**.

### InShort API

I used [Unofficial InShorts News API](https://github.com/cyberboysumanjay/Inshorts-News-API) to get
the news shown in the apps.

Tech Stack:

- Compose for Android UI
- SwiftUI for iOS UI
- MVVM
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Ktor for api calls
- Koin for dependency injection
- Room for caching
- and more...
